#Remove unused columns, then re-order pigments to match retention/peak time. Remove pigments not used for Chemtax (need to consider this as some might be useful). Might be best to actually keep all of the pigments and then filter for them when making plots. This way it is more adaptive?

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
